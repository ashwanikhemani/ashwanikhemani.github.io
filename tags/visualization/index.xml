      <description>I get my weather updates from the weather channel !!! I usually visit weather channel because it provides the most accurate and up to date weather updates. It shows hourly, daily and weekly weather forecast in an organized manner. The website and phone application are easy to navigate and to use. I highly recommend the application to everyone.</description>
