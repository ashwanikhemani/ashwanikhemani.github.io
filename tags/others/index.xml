Interesting things which were found about the data using the application.
The findings are given below for the Cook county of Illinois.
 Amongst the pollutants, SO2 pollutant has shown a relatively downward trend over the last 25 years with some exceptions in certain years. PM2.5 pollutant has shown a relatively upward trend over the last 25 years with some exceptions in certain years. CO , Carbon monozide emission has been neglible over the last 20 years  These trends show that there has been an effor to reduce harmful emissions but at the same time there are still emissions that need to be controlled to bring them under permissible range.</description>

      <description>I get my weather updates from the weather channel !!! I usually visit weather channel because it provides the most accurate and up to date weather updates. It shows hourly, daily and weekly weather forecast in an organized manner. The website and phone application are easy to navigate and to use. I highly recommend the application to everyone.</description>

When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function
When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post

I tried to relate it to my real life experience and it definitely did make a lot of sense. I have seen myself sometimes repeating and sharing the same advice with my friends and colleagues.</description>
