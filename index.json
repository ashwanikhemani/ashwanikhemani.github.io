I have seen myself sometimes repeating and sharing the same advice with my friends and colleagues. So, I decided to start my own blog to share my learnings and experiences with everyone.\nI enjoy reading and have become an avid reader (I would have been surprised if someone said that about me a couple of years ago). I love to read about a lot of varied topics and yes anything related to the computers (we go long way back) and the technology. Currently, I am more occupied with reading academic texts and papers about topics of my interests and I would love to share anything I find interesting in them. Apart from reading, I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with people which is the main motivation behind this blog.\nTalking to people who are new to the field or are nervous because of the initial experience with something and helping them is something I have always cherished. \u0026ldquo;Success is not counted by how high you have climbed but by how many people you brought with you\u0026rdquo;.And I try to stand by this each and every day of my life. I do sometimes digress to philosophy even when I try very hard not to, I promise I would avoid it in the future posts :) But, coming back to the purpose of this blog and the interests that I would like to talk about here.\nI currently find the areas of machine learning and distributed systems very fascinating. I would love to share my perspective about different concepts and try to make topics in these areas more interesting and understandable.\nI recently read an article which talked about deep learning, I apologize for the jargon. Let\u0026rsquo;s for now not focus on what does it mean as it\u0026rsquo;s not that important at the moment. The article said that the fact that deep learning is hyped is itself hyped. I agree with it as people are trying to make use of buzzwords to gain traction and there is nothing wrong with that. My point is, yes, it may be hyped, but what differentiates a genuine enthusiast and person who wants to make use of any form of science and technology is not how much hype one can create, it\u0026rsquo;s about how much impact one can have with their creation over the world and its population. This is the sole reason behind my curiosity about machine learning and distributed systems. I think they are very useful and if people try to make use of them to solve real-world problems, the opportunities are endless !!\nI might sometimes write about some non-technical topics also, but I would try to keep them separate. I have found the internet and online communities very useful for the knowledge I have gained in my life. This is my way to give something back to it !! I hope this blog would be useful for everyone and I would love to hear your comments and feedback.\nStay tuned !!!\n","date":1538184180,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538187780,"objectID":"ba6423d815d4f5949b7a69912feb741d","permalink":"/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2018-09-28T20:23:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Start of something exciting !!","tags":["others"],"title":"Time for a new beginning !!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Investigated many Devops pipeline programs and obtained statistical data that describe content and patterns in Devops pipelines.\n Java, Jenkins, GitHub\n  Source Code available here.\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"2c0e1c5341dc83c08489e133b4ebf2c6","permalink":"/project/pa/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/pa/","section":"project","summary":"Comprehensive analysis of Devops pipelines","tags":["DevOps"],"title":"An Empirical Investigation into Large-Scale Devops Pipeline programs","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Designed and developed parallel optimization algorithm based on the LBFGS solver provided by PETSc, leveraging its parallel primitives and testing the scalability on cluster Implemented stochastic gradient solvers (SGD and ADAM), and tested their efficiency in comparison with LBFGS  Source Code available here.\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"c7f19c2080d957ec72f0f578592e522d","permalink":"/project/crf/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/crf/","section":"project","summary":"Parallel and Stochastic optimization of Conditional Random Field for optical character recognition (OCR)","tags":["machine-learning"],"title":"Conditional Random Field for optical character recognition (OCR)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Created a DevOps application workflow for automatically building and analyzing software applications statically as part of the workflow to obtain information about relationships among components of these applications.

In this project we look at its performance on two well known datasets, cityscapes and CSAIL Places, and try to see the impact of modifying hyperparameters and using different network architectures in the backbone.\n Summary of the Problem Instance Segmentation is the combination of three other tasks making it very difficult. Those three tasks are Image Classification, Object Detection, and Semantic Segmentation. See Figure 1 for an overview of the task.   Instance Segmentation\nImage Classification, being the most studied of the three, is a task where you are given an image and the goal is to classify it. Examples of such studies are those done on the MNIST dataset [1]. In MNIST, the task is to classify handwritten digits given only an image of the digit. Some of the most successful approaches involve CNN architectures, like VGG, GoogleLeNet, ResNet, and many others. Object Detection has the same domain, but the goal is to find all instances of an object and find the smallest bounding box around the object. One way to structure this as a machine learning task is to formulate it as a Regression problem, where the bounding box is defined by a set of coordinates. This is done in our Mask R-CNN implementation and its immediate predecessor, Faster R-CNN [2]. The goal of Semantic Segmentation is to classify each pixel, effectively segmenting an image into its semantic components. This was a difficult task because there was no obvious way to generate predictions for each pixel, without feeding the whole image multiple times through a traditional CNN classification network, and this would make the problem intractable. One well known solution to this is to use a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), which would have an Encoder/Decoder structure by first using Convolution Layers and Pooling\n Cityscapes Cityscapes has data from street scenes, so an application of a network trained on this dataset is autonomous vehicles. The dataset has approximately 5,000 examples and 30 classes with fine grain annotations. We used about 3,500 for training and 500 for validation.\n CSAIL Places This dataset is more general and has a wide variety of scenes. It has approximately 20K examples (2K validation), with annotations, and 100 classes. The CSAIL places dataset will give us an opportunity to compare our results with work published that tested with more popular datasets like MSCOCO [4].\n Mask R-CNN Architecture\n  ","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"ab53399cabd74b2e9f3914a5627002ef","permalink":"/project/maskrcnn/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/maskrcnn/","section":"project","summary":"Instance Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks","tags":["machine-learning"],"title":"Instance Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Performed Monte-Carlo simulation for evaluation of stock purchase decisions that runs on Spark and deployed on private OctaPi cloud using Kubernetes Java, Spark, Docker, K8s  Source Code available here .\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"f09b93d28e84184bf0b2750b16219988","permalink":"/project/mcs/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/mcs/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluation of stock investment decisions using Monte-Carlo simulation and OctaPi cloud","tags":["Cloud"],"title":"Monte-Carlo simulation with OctaPi cloud","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Built and designed an OctaPi cloud cluster of Raspberry PI devices to run a Hadoop map/reduce application to make software testing process parallel and efficient Automated deploying, scaling, and operating application containers on Raspberry Pi using Kubernetes Java, Hadoop, Docker, K8s  Source Code available here .\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"ffce5bc471c746c2d8d11b199640d7e3","permalink":"/project/st/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/st/","section":"project","summary":"Automation of software testing process using Hadoop","tags":["Cloud"],"title":"Parallelization of software testing using Hadoop Map-Reduce model and OctaPi Cluster","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Conducted comparative study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for Sentiment Analysis Designed deep learning models to achieve state of the art performance on complex task such as sentiment analysis on twitter dataset  Source Code available here .\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"1e6260de844a02b205bddca42ade9aac","permalink":"/project/sm/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/sm/","section":"project","summary":"Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Corpus","tags":["machine-learning"],"title":"Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Corpus","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Obtained information about program entities that were modified because of fixes to specific bugs/issues and found useful pattern amongst them using static code analysis tool like Understand Python, GitHub, Understand  Source Code available here.\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"5743653686b326694095c44c8ad1ea52","permalink":"/project/sca/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/sca/","section":"project","summary":"Checking the open source projects for the frequently occuring issues","tags":["DevOps"],"title":"Static Code Analyzer to find most common bugs in Open Source Projects","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Developed a conditional random field model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), with emphasis on inference and performance test Performed benchmarking by comparing CRF with multi-class linear SVM  Source Code available here .\n","date":1537592400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537592400,"objectID":"6dc0692cb8ed303095aec81aa6bee6a5","permalink":"/project/crf_1/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/crf_1/","section":"project","summary":"Conditional Random Field for optical character recognition (OCR)","tags":["machine-learning"],"title":"Structured Output Prediction using Conditional Random Fields","type":"project"}]
